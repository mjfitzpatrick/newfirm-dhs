Directory Contents:
-------------------

    README	    - This File

    bin		    - Application bin directory.  Users need not put this
		      in their path unless they need to start clients directly,
	 	      the DHS is started/stopped using the 'startdhs' and 
		      'stopdhs' scripts in this directory.

    client	    - Example/Test client app

    collector	    - Source directory for the collector component.  The
		      collector receives pixel/metadata from the PanSaver 
		      and stores the result in the SMC.

    dev		    - Development scripts/utilities.  These are mostly used
		      as convenience routines for development however some
		      have made their way into the deployed system (e.g.
		      the 'z.mosdca' as a startup script so we can capture
		      the DCA output for debugging).

    dhssup	    - DHS Supervisor source code.  This is the orchestrator
		      application with a GUI.

    doc  	    - A sadly empty documentation directory.

    include  	    - Header files from interfaces used in clients

    lib		    - DHS Interface libraries
     lib/NOCS.map      - KTM keyword mapping for NOCS metadata
     lib/PAN.map       - KTM keyword mapping for PAN metadata

     lib/newfirm.dat      - KTM data for ccd layout, WCS template, etc
     lib/newfirm.tcl      - KTM entry point
     lib/newfirmsrc.tcl   - KTM source code (does the real work)

     lib/config.null   - Configuration file
     lib/config.sim    - Configuration file (for simulator)

     lib/generic.tcl   - Generic do-nothing KTM code
     lib/hosts	       - IRAF networking host-table used by QL pipeline

     lib/_netw      - API used by PAN/NOCS (Nick or Phil's version)
     lib/cdl	    - Client-Display Library used for Real-Time Display
     lib/cfitsio    - CFITSIO code for use by PXF when writing local files
     lib/dcalib     - Utility routines for talking to the PAN/NOCS clients 
     lib/dhslib     - API used by PAN/NOCS for talking to the DHS
     lib/ndhs	    - Utility routines for handling DHS readout sequences.
		      NOTE:  the ndhsConfigureImage() procedure here contains
		  	     instrument-specific params
     lib/msg	    - Message Bus abstract interface library.  Used by clients
		      to send/recv messages via the message bus rather than
		      use PVM directly
     lib/pvm3	    - PVM message bus source code
     lib/smc	    - Shared-Memory Cache Interface library
     lib/vnc	    - Password and startup files for VNC

    lib32  	    - 32-bit X11 libraries used when not available on some
		      platforms (e.g. 64-bit)

    mosdca	    - DCA source code.  This is only slightly modified from
		      the original (i.e. Arcon-based) DCA.

    pxf		    - Source directory for the PXF component.  The PXF
		      monitors the SMC for new data and creates a FITS image
		      on disk.

    smcmgr	    - Source directory for the Shared Memory Cache (SMC)
		      Manager.  The SMCMGR rectifies the pixel arrays so they
		      are properly rotated for display to the RTD and when
		      written to the FITS file (i.e. LL corner is 1st pixel).

    test	    - Sample test directory.  Code in here is meant to 
		      simulate the instrument readout, with separate clients
		      acting as the NOCS/PAN and the 'exp' task controlling
		      the sequence the way the instrument would.

    util	    - Utility scripts.  May or may not be useful.

    x11iraf	    - X11IRAF

    zzkpvm	    - Convenience link to nuke all PVM/SMC traces on the
		      machine
